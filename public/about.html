<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In case you can't tell yet, I love chemistry. Especially organic. 
  I did say once that MgO was a covalent compound. We don't talk about that. </p>

<p>If I'm not sleeping, eating or drumming, you're probably going to find me: 
  <ol>
    <li>Puzzling over a question </li>
    <li>Realising that I messed up the +ve and -ve signs </li>
    <li>Having a complete existential crisis </li>
    <li>And then going back to loving studying </li>
  </ol>
  It's a cycle in that order.
